# PineScript AI — Environment Variables
#
# This app uses a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model.
# All configuration — API keys, model selection, provider — is managed
# through the browser UI and stored in localStorage.
#
# No server-side environment variables are required.
#
# Just run:
#   npm install
#   npm run dev
#
# Then configure your provider and API key at http://localhost:3000
